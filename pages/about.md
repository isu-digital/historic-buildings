Initiated in 2024 and currently a work in progress, this site explores the history of the buildings of Iowa State University through historic photographs, maps, and modern GIS data.

This project is led by Kevin Kane, director emeritus of the Iowa State University GIS Support and Research Facility, and Erin Ridnour, digital scholarship librarian at Iowa State University Library.
