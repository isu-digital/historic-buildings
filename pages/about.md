Beginning in 2023, this project proposed researching how an open source geographic information system (QGIS) could bring together historical maps, photos, and texts to study the planniing and building of the Iowa State University campus. Through a partnership with the ISU Library's Digital Scholarship and Initiatives department in 2024, this site shares the progress we have made exploring this campus history through historical photographs, maps, and modern GIS Data. 

This project is a work in progress, and is led by [Kevin Kane, director emeritus](https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/kkane/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} of the Iowa State University GIS Support and Research Facility, and [Erin Ridnour, digital scholarship librarian](https://www.lib.iastate.edu/people/erin-ridnour){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at Iowa State University Library.
