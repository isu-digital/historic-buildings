hist_01,,Marston Cottage,,,,1868,1958,5200,C.A. Dunham,N.P. Starks,,"Marston Cottage was built between 1868 and 1870. The third of the three original ""Professors' Houses"" was first occupied by Professor William A. Anthony until he resigned in 1884. Anthony shared the house with Albert E. Foote and E.R. Hutchins. General James Rush Lincoln was the next occupant from 1885 to 1891. From 1892 until his death in 1949, the cottage was home to Anson Marston, whom he shared with Samual W. Beyer. Mrs. Marston continued to live in the house until it was razed in 1958 to permit the construction of the Helser Hall addition. 
The house was brick, with a basement, two full floors, and a large attic. The back stairs were added in 1874. Major repairs were undertaken in 1904. The front porch was screened in 1913, and in 1923, a garage was built into the basement.

He sold the house to the College in 1884, when an addition was constructed from plans by Foster and Lieve. Tomlinson built the addition for $780. Budd received $2,000 for the house. The addition was two stories, 14 x 22 feet. The house's chimneys were blown down in the April 8, 1882 cyclone. 

Selection of the location where Budd's house stood as the site for Agricultural Hall(Botony Hall) resulted in the removal of the house in 1892 to an area now the southwest corner of the Dairy Industries Building. Moving, including a new foundation, costs approximately $1,000. The house was razed in 1927 to make room for the new Dairy Industries Building.

hist_20,,Old Main (Main),,,,1864; 1871,1901; 1902,150000,C.A. Dunham,Jacob Reichard,College Building; The College; Old Main,"Old Main, originally known as Main or the College, stood approximately where Beardshear Hall now stands for only 34 years. When it was built, and many years after, it held the entire college. It housed classrooms, the library, chapel, museums, and dining halls and was the residence of faculty and students. Plans for the College Building began as early as 1858, but construction couldn't start until after the Civil War financial strains had passed, in the spring of 1864.

The construction of the building was plagued with problems from the very start. The original architect was discharged after the first year of construction for incompetence. When the second architect was hired, he determined that the foundation done in the last year needed to be fixed, due to the poor bricks used. The work done in 1864 was ordered to be destroyed, and construction started in the spring of 1865. The new architect also found the plans in need of serious revisions. Despite these revisions, it was discovered once construction was completed that there were no water, lighting, heat, or drainage provisions in the structure.

In 1882, a tornado damaged the south tower. A fire in 1900 destroyed the entire north wing and much of the interior of the center section and damaged much of the remaining building. The damage was barely repaired in 1902 when another fire struck, this time in the south wing, destroying the building. Plans for constructing Beardshear Hall on the same site began shortly after.

Stuckslager; David Dale,Stanton Hall; Hospital; Detention Ward,"Enrollments at the College were increasing to the extent that Old Main could only accommodate some students. In 1870 it had been proposed that a dormitory building, harmonizing with the College Building, should be erected northwest of it and provide facilities to house 120 students. The legislature appropriated no funds for that structure. Ten years later, funds were made available for Boarding Cottages. Bids were taken on proposals for six-room and eight-room houses. The contract was awarded to F.S. Whiting to build a 16-room building. The final cost exceeded the $3,500 appropriation by $206.50.

This is at a location just at the southeast corner of the present Agronomy Greenhouse. This barn was built in 1880 under contract with F.S. Whiting for $725. Painting and other costs brought the total expenditure to $ 792.10. In 1890, Experimental Station Director Speer was authorized to use proceeds from the sale of Station products to repair the barn. A fire starting in this barn in October 1901 destroyed it and the Experiment Station Barn.

Eastwood for a farm workman's house, which he would lease from the college. In the spring of 1879, he was furnished wire and posts to enclose the acre of land. At the end of that year, Eastwood was granted permission to remove his house from the college grounds, but he decided against that action because he offered to sell it to the college two years later. The sale was executed in the spring of 1882. Removal of the house was considered later, but in 1888, it was being used by the Experiment Station. No subsequent references to the home have been found. The house appears on an 1883 map but is not shown on an 1896 map. It was apparently razed or removed sometime between 1888 and 1896.

The building was completed for occupancy in 1881. On April 8, 1882, a tornado crossed the campus, causing damage to North Hall. Repairs were made the next month. A parch was added on the south side in 1886. Two years later, a water supply and coal stoves were provided. 
When Margaret Hall was built in 1894, North Hall became an attached wing of the new building. The lower floor was made into a kitchen; the second floor was remodeled for the Department of Domestic Economy and living rooms, while the was set up for servants' rooms. North Hall was taken down in 1926.

He willed it to his sister, Sallie Stalker Smith, who, in turn, willed it to her sisters, Margaret Stalker and Julia Stalker Swearingen, during their lifetimes. After their deaths, the property was to go to Iowa State College in the name of Milliken Stalker and Sallie Stalker Smith to further the cause of international goodwill. Ownership of the property passed to the College in 1928. The Gables became International House as a residence for International male students in compliance with Mrs. Smith's will. A fire on January 7, 1951, resulted in extensive damage to the house. The house continued in use by International students until it was purposely burned down in 1963 to make way for Buchanan Hall, which continued as an International student residence.

It was commonly called the ""Dinkey Station"" during the years it served as a depot for the steam railway that ran between downtown Ames and Iowa State College. When the steam railway was replaced with an electric streetcar in 1907, the building was moved further north, away from Beardshear, to its present location. In 1920, an addition was built on the north side to increase space for the bookstore and post office. It was in the 1920s that a group of men, the ""Sunshine Club,"" would assemble on the steps during sunny days for birdwatching and heavy discussion.
In 1946, another building was moved and attached to the west side, and in 1953, the east wing was built. The bookstore moved to the Memorial Union in 1953, and the post office moved out ten years later. In 1959, the building officially became ""the Hub"" when vending services were added. During the next 20 years, a copy center, ticket office, and the University Traffic Office moved into the Hub. By 1983, the traffic office and ticket office were relocated, and the outdoor seating area to the west was built.

The first floor hosted the department of agricultural chemistry and the horticulture department. There was also a livestock room for class purposes. The second and third floors held offices and recitation rooms. The fourth floor was employed for some of the literary and scientific societies of the college. In 1897, there had been noticeable floor settlement and a considerable amount of plaster cracking. A new Farm Mechanics and Soil Physics Building was constructed as an addition on the north side of Agricultural Hall in 1903. Various modifications and repairs were made over the years. After the Agricultural Engineering department moved to its new building in 19222, the old quarters were used primarily for storage. In 1929, the Botany department moved into the old Agricultural Hall, and the building was renamed Botany Hall.

Named to honor the Senator who had sponsored the Morrill bill, which had established the land-grant college system, Morrill Hall was built at a cost of less than $30,000. Since its construction, it has been home to zoology, entomology, and geology classes and labs, Agriculture Extension Offices, the Printing Office, Photo Service, and even a barber shop from 1905-1908. Morrill Hall has been vacant since 1996, when it was deemed unsafe. Renovation on Morrill Hall began in 2005 and is expected to be completed in 2007. The projected cost of the renovation is $9,000,000, most of which came from private donations. Morrill Hall will house the Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching, the Center for Visual Learning in Textiles and Clothing, and the Christian Petersen Art Museum.

That was a temporary home for that department because in May 1894 it was also assigned to the department of Botany, and underwent some repair, remodeling, and painting. The building was moved in 1896 to a location that is now the center of the west wing of MacKay Hll, just north of Margaret Hall. It became a home for employees of the boarding department in Margaret Hall, and was known as the Klatter Klub. It was moved again in 1910 to about the center of the east wing on MacKay Hall. During that time is was the residence of Thomas Sloss, Superintendent of Building and Grounds, who made it his family home un 1924. The house was again moved between December 1924 and March 1925 southwest of the southwest corner of teh Metallurgy Building where is became the Isabel Bevier Home Management House. The building was again moved to north of Pammel Drive, facing west on what is now called North Morrill Road. Bevier House continued as a home management house unitl 1953 and again served that function in 1955-1956. In 1953-1955 and 1956-1961 it was a home for graduate women.

In 1885, after the new Veterinary Hospital was completed, the barn was transferred to the use of the boarding department upon payment by that department of $300 to the College Treasurer. This is almost certainly the barn referred to in the Sept. 1892 action of the Board approving the transfer of the ""bus house and barn"" to the Agricultural department and approval of moving them to a new location. The following May, the Building Committee was instructed ""to act at one"" to remove the ""house and barn belonging to the steward's department from the grounds set aside for the Athletic Association."" The Biennial Report for 1892-93 reports that the two buildings had been ""moved to a more suitable location and put in better repair condition."" It is thought that the site selected for the new location of the house was on the south side of the road near west gate, but where the barn was moved is not known.

The longest resident, Thomas Sloss, moved in in 1925. Sloss was superintendent of buildings, and during the 11 years that he lived in the home, he did various remodeling and additions, including extending the south porch, removing the west porch, and adding a garage to the northwest corner, sunroom, study, and bath. The Sloss House now is the home of the Margaret Sloss Women's Center, named after Thomas Sloss's daughter, who was the first woman to earn a Doctorate in Veterinary Medicine and a faculty member from 1923 to 1972.

Osborn was not the intended first occupant, the house was built originally for a professor and his wife. When the wife arrived from Boston, she promptly refused to live in the home because of the remoteness, so they moved into a home in Ames.
In 1968, the Foreign Student Services, Student Alumni Association, and Landscape Architecture department began using the building. The Honors Program began using the building in 1976.
