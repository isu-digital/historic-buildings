hist_01,,Marston Cottage,,,,"Marston Cottage was built between 1868 and 1870. The third of the three original ""Professors' Houses"" was first occupied by Professor William A. Anthony until he resigned in 1884. Anthony shared the house with Albert E. Foote and E.R. Hutchins. General James Rush Lincoln was the next occupant from 1885 to 1891. From 1892 until his death in 1949, the cottage was home to Anson Marston, whom he shared with Samual W. Beyer. Mrs. Marston continued to live in the house until it was razed in 1958 to permit the construction of the Helser Hall addition. 

The house was brick, with a basement, two full floors, and a large attic. The back stairs were added in 1874. Major repairs were undertaken in 1904. The front porch was screened in 1913, and 1923 a garage was built into the basement.

The house was renovated for use by the Domestic Economy Department in 1880. The house was damaged by a tornado in 1882. Beginning in 1896, the building served as the Music Hall until it was destroyed by fire in 1912.

Stanton lived with Jones's family while they lived in the house, and from 1879 to Stanton's death in 1920 the home was known as the Stanton House. The house was remodeled and enlarged in 1899. After her husband's death, Mrs. Stanton continued to live in the house, and when she started a tea room in 1922, the home became known as ""The Maples."" Mrs. Stanton moved out in 1924, and the Home Economics Department continued the operation of the tea room. The east (front) porch was enclosed and the kitchen enlarged in 1926. The tearoom closed in 1928 with the opening of the Memorial Union and the Music Department moved in. The name ""Music Hall"" became official in 1929. The house was torn down in 1978 for the new music building that was constructed on the site.

hist_14,,Mortensen Cottage,,,,"An acre of land was leased to Professor J.L Budd in May 1877, and he began building a home for his family. He sold the house to the College in 1884, at which time an addition was built from plans by Foster and Lieve. Tomlinson built the addition for $780. Budd received $2,000 for the house. The addition was two stories, 14 x 22 feet. The chimneys of the house were blown down in the cyclone of April 8, 1882. 

Selection of the location where Budd's house stood as the site for Agricultural Hall(Botony Hall) resulted in the removal of the house in 1892 to an area now the southwest corner of the Dairy Industries Building. The cost of moving, including a new foundation, was approximately $1,000. The house was razed in 1927 to make room for the new Dairy Industries Building.

hist_20,,Old Main (Main),,,,"Old Main, originally known as Main or the College, stood approximately where Beardshear Hall now stands for only 34 years. When it was built and for many years after, it held the entire college. It housed classrooms, the library, chapel, museums, and dining halls and was the residence of faculty and students. Plans for the College Building began as early as 1858, but construction wasn't able to begin until after the Civil War financial strains had passed, in the spring of 1864.

The construction of the building was plagued with problems from the very start. The original architect was discharged after the first year of construction for incompetence. When the second architect was hired, he determined that the foundation done in the last year was unstable, due to the poor bricks used. The work done in 1864 was ordered to be destroyed, and construction started over in the spring of 1865. The new architect also found the plans in need of serious revisions. In spite of these revisions, it was discovered once construction was completed that there were no provisions in the structure for water, lighting, heat or drainage.

In 1882, a tornado damaged the south tower. A fire in 1900 destroyed the entire north wing and much of the interior of the center section and damaged much of the remaining building. The damage was barely repaired in 1902 when another fire struck, this time in the south wing, completely destroying the building. Plans for constructing Beardshear Hall on the same site began shortly after.

The contract to rebuild was awarded to Fred Fisher later that month, and the new structure was occupied the following February. The silo which received the lightning blow was not rebuilt until 1935. Fire struck again on October 19, 1958, when the east wing roof was burned along with a large quantity of hay. The silos were razed in 1968.

hist_64,,Boarding Cottage West,,,,"Enrollments at the College were increasing to the extent that Old Main could not accommodate all of the students. In 1870 it had been proposed that a dormitory building, harmonizing with the College Building, should be erected northwest of it and provide facilities to house 120 students. No funds were appropriated by the legislature for that structure. Ten years later, funds were made available for Boarding Cottages. Bids were taken on proposals for six-room and eight-room houses. The contract was awarded to F.S. Whiting to build a 16-room building. The final cost exceeded the $3,500 appropriation by $206.50.

hist_69,,Feeding Barn,,,,"The ""Feed Barn"" is shown on the 1883 map in a location about 600 feet east of the F&RM Barn. This is at a location just at the southeast corner of the present Agronomy Greenhouse. This barn was built in 1880 under contract with F.S. Whiting in the amount of $725. Painting and other costs brought the total expenditure to $792 .10. In 1890, Experimental Station Director Speer was authorized to use proceeds from the sale of Station products for the repair of the barn. A fire starting in this barn in October 1901 destroyed it and the Experiment Station Barn.

hist_73,,Eastwood Cottage,,,,"Built in 1878 located just northeast of the cemetery on open land. A one-acre farm site was allocated in November 1877 to L.L. Eastwood for a farm workman's house, which he would lease from the college. In the spring of 1879, he was furnished wire and posts to enclose the acre of land. At the end of that year, Eastwood was granted permission to remove his house from the college grounds, but he apparently decided against that action because he offered to sell it to the college two years later. The sale was executed in the spring of 1882. Removal of the house was considered later, but in 1888, it was being used by the Experiment Station. No subsequent references to the house have been found. The house appears on an 1883 map but is not shown on an 1896 map. It was apparently razed or removed sometime between 1888 and 1896.

The building was completed for occupancy in 1881. On April 8, 1882, a tornado crossed the campus, causing damage to North Hall. Repairs were made the next month. A parch was added on the south side in 1886. Two years later, a water supply and coal stoves were provided. 
When Margaret Hall was built in 1894, North Hall became an attached wing of the new building. The lower floor was made into a kitchen, the second floor was remodeled for the Department of Domestic Economy and living rooms, while the was set up for servants' rooms. North Hall was taken down in 1926.

Professor Millikan Stalker purchased ""The Gables,"" as it was called, in 1898 or 1899 and moved into it in 1899. He willed it to his sister, Sallie Stalker Smith, who, in turn, willed it to her sisters, Margaret Stalker and Julia Stalker Swearingen, during their lifetimes. After their deaths, the property was to go to Iowa State College in the name of Milliken Stalker and Sallie Stalker Smith to further the cause of international goodwill. Ownership of the property passed to the College in 1928. The Gables became International House as a residence for International male students in compliance with Mrs. Smith's will. A fire on January 7, 1951, resulted in extensive damage to the house. The house continued in use by International students until it was purposely burned down in 1963 to make way for Buchanan Hall, which continued as an International student residence.
